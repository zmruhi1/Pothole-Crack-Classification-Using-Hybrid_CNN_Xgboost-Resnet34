# Abstract

Roads in Bangladesh provide infrastructural facilities
to both agricultural as well as industrial sectors of the
country. Distressed roads can cause fatal accidents as well
as largely decelerate sector progress. This makes swift road
inspection and repairs one of the most important aspects of
our country’s holistic growth. As much as it affects the general
public, tackling this is as big a problem for the government as
well. Currently, the problem for road repair is a multi-stage
problem, which involves getting a complaint from a resident,
physical road inspection by some official, identifying the type
of damage and then comes the process of actually repairing
it. Here, we intend to make this cumbersome process simpler,
by automating the problem identification stage. We developed a
method leveraging the Machine Learning and Deep Learning
capabilities that can potentially detect a damaged road and
identify the type of damage viz. pothole and crack. We selfcaptured
data from the roads and streets, thus emulating the
data we expect when this method is used in real-life by installing
cameras on the city corporation’s garbage trucks. We reviewed
various models ranging from conventional machine learning to
complex deep learning algorithms and ultimately shortlisted three
models: CNN, CNN-XGboost, and ResNet. These three models
were then optimized for our problem, and then extensive testing
was performed to determine the one that outperforms the rest.
ResNet-34 emerged as a clear winner, with an accuracy of 87.8 %
on the test data. Here, we’ll do an in-depth study of the efficacy
of these models on our problem statement.
